# Task: Vercel Deployment Setup

## Description

Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel and configure automatic deployments for preview environments on pull requests and production deployments on merges to main. This enables continuous deployment and easy testing of changes before they reach production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub repository connected to Vercel project
- [ ] Automatic deployments enabled for main branch (production)
- [ ] Preview deployments enabled for pull requests
- [ ] Environment variables configured (if any needed)
- [ ] Build settings verified (Next.js framework auto-detected)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployment protection rules set up (optional - e.g., require CI checks)
- [ ] Team has access to Vercel project
- [ ] First successful deployment to production completed

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**

1. Log in to Vercel dashboard
2. Import GitHub repository
3. Configure project settings:
   - Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `.next`
   - Install command: `npm install`
4. Set up environment variables via Vercel dashboard
5. Enable automatic deployments
6. Test with a sample deployment

**Key Considerations:**

- Vercel auto-detects Next.js projects and applies optimal settings
- Preview deployments create unique URLs for each PR
- Environment variables should be managed securely in Vercel dashboard
- Consider separate projects for staging/production if needed
- Deployment hooks can trigger on successful deployments

**Files Affected:**

- No code files modified (configuration is in Vercel dashboard)
- Potentially `.vercelignore` if certain files should be excluded
- Documentation files to record deployment URLs and process

## Dependencies

- [ ] GitHub repository must be accessible
- [ ] Vercel account with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Project builds successfully locally

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S (Small)
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented - Repository connected and configured in Vercel
- [ ] Tests written and passing - Test deployment successful
- [ ] Documentation updated - Deployment process and URLs documented
- [ ] Code reviewed - Configuration reviewed by team member
- [ ] Deployed to staging - Preview deployment verified on test PR
