# Task: Health Check & Monitoring

## Description

Create a comprehensive health check endpoint and basic monitoring infrastructure to validate system health and enable proactive monitoring of the application in production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/api/health` endpoint created and returns proper status codes
- [ ] Health check validates database connectivity
- [ ] Response includes app version and deployment ID
- [ ] Vercel uptime monitoring configured
- [ ] Health check integrated with deployment validation
- [ ] Error states return appropriate HTTP status codes (500 for unhealthy)

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

1. **Create Health Check API Route**
   - Location: `src/app/api/health/route.ts`
   - Implements GET endpoint
   - Returns JSON response with health status

2. **Health Checks to Implement**
   - Database connectivity (simple query)
   - Application version (from package.json)
   - Deployment ID (from Vercel environment variables)
   - Timestamp of health check

3. **Response Format**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy",
     "timestamp": "2025-10-30T17:16:20Z",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "deploymentId": "dpl_xxx",
     "checks": {
       "database": {
         "status": "healthy",
         "responseTime": 45
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Configure health check path in Vercel dashboard
   - Set appropriate timeout values
   - Configure uptime monitoring alerts

### Key Considerations

- Health check should execute quickly (< 1 second)
- Use connection pooling for database checks
- Cache health status briefly to prevent overwhelming database
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
- Include deployment metadata from Vercel environment variables

### Code Locations/Files Affected

- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` (new file)
- Vercel dashboard configuration
- Optional: `src/lib/health-checks.ts` (utility functions)

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 002: Vercel Deployment Setup (needs Vercel environment)
- [x] Task 005: Database & Migration Setup (needs database connection)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Extra Small (XS)
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (independent API route, can run alongside documentation and other tasks)

### Time Breakdown
- Health endpoint implementation: 1 hour
- Database connectivity check: 0.5 hours
- Vercel monitoring configuration: 0.5 hours
- Testing and validation: 0.5-1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and follows Next.js App Router conventions
- [ ] Health endpoint returns correct status for healthy system
- [ ] Health endpoint returns degraded/unhealthy status when database is down
- [ ] Unit tests written for health check logic
- [ ] Manual testing completed on preview environment
- [ ] Vercel uptime monitoring configured and tested
- [ ] Documentation added to deployment runbook
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging and validated
- [ ] Production deployment verified

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test health check response format
   - Mock database failures and verify error handling
   - Verify proper status code returns

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test with actual database connection
   - Verify response times
   - Test with Vercel environment variables

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Hit endpoint in preview environment
   - Simulate database failure (disconnect)
   - Verify Vercel monitoring dashboard shows status

## Notes

This task is independent and can be completed in parallel with documentation tasks. The health check endpoint is critical for production reliability and should include comprehensive error handling.
