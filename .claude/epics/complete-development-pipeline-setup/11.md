### Implementation Approach

This task follows a phased deployment approach with comprehensive validation at each step.

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation

1. **Environment Validation**
   - Verify all Vercel production environment variables set
   - Confirm database connection string configured
   - Validate Sentry DSN for production
   - Review security settings (CORS, CSP headers)

2. **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

   - [ ] Staging environment fully tested
   - [ ] Database migrations tested on staging
   - [ ] Test suite passing (100% success rate)
   - [ ] Security audit completed
   - [ ] Performance baseline established
   - [ ] Backup plan documented

3. **Team Communication**
   - Notify team of deployment window
   - Share deployment plan and timeline
   - Assign roles (deployer, monitor, communicator)
   - Prepare rollback plan

### Phase 2: Production Deployment

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Promote staging deployment to production in Vercel
   - OR: Merge to production branch (if using branch-based deploys)
   - Monitor deployment progress in Vercel dashboard
   - Watch build logs for errors

2. **Database Migration**
   - Migrations run automatically via Vercel build script
   - Monitor migration logs for errors
   - Verify migration completion in database

3. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Verify deployment ID and version number
   - Check health endpoint: `https://[domain]/api/health`
   - Verify application loads correctly
   - Test critical user flows manually

### Phase 3: System Validation

1. **Health Check Validation**

   ```bash
   curl https://[production-domain]/api/health
   # Expect: {"status": "healthy", ...}
   ```

2. **Database Connectivity**
   - Verify database queries executing successfully
   - Check connection pool metrics
   - Validate data integrity

3. **Error Tracking Validation**
   - Trigger test error in production (controlled)
   - Verify error appears in Sentry within 1 minute
   - Confirm source maps working correctly
   - Validate alert notifications

4. **Performance Validation**
   - Check Core Web Vitals in Vercel Analytics
   - Verify page load times acceptable
   - Monitor server response times
   - Check CDN cache hit rates

5. **Security Validation**
   - Verify HTTPS working (SSL certificate)
   - Check security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
   - Validate CORS configuration
   - Test authentication flows (if applicable)

### Phase 4: Smoke Testing

Execute production smoke tests:

1. **Critical Path Testing**
   - Homepage loads successfully
   - API endpoints responding
   - Database queries executing
   - Error tracking operational

2. **User Flow Testing**
   - Test key user journeys
   - Verify forms submitting correctly
   - Check navigation and routing
   - Validate responsive design

3. **Integration Testing**
   - External API integrations working
   - Third-party services connected
   - Email/notifications sending (if applicable)

### Phase 5: Monitoring Setup

1. **Configure Alerts**
   - Sentry error rate alerts
   - Vercel uptime monitoring
   - Performance degradation alerts
   - Database connection alerts

2. **Dashboard Setup**
   - Vercel Analytics dashboard
   - Sentry issues dashboard
   - Database monitoring (if applicable)

3. **On-Call Setup**
   - Define incident response team
   - Set up alert routing
   - Document escalation procedures

### Phase 6: Rollback Testing

1. **Test Rollback Procedure**
   - Document current deployment ID
   - Perform test rollback to previous deployment
   - Verify application still works
   - Roll forward to current deployment
   - Document rollback execution time

2. **Create Rollback Runbook**
   - When to rollback (decision criteria)
   - How to rollback (step-by-step)
   - How to verify rollback success
   - Communication during rollback

### Code Locations/Files Affected

- Vercel production environment configuration
- Production environment variables
- DNS/domain configuration (if applicable)
- `docs/deployment/production-deployment-log.md` (new - deployment record)
- `docs/deployment/incident-response-runbook.md` (new)

## Dependencies

This task requires ALL previous tasks to be completed:

- [x] Task 001: GitHub Actions CI Workflow
- [x] Task 002: Vercel Deployment Setup

## Incident Response Runbook

Create comprehensive incident response runbook covering:

1. **Severity Levels**
   - P0 (Critical): Complete outage
   - P1 (High): Major functionality broken
   - P2 (Medium): Minor functionality issues
   - P3 (Low): Cosmetic issues

2. **Response Procedures**
   - Incident detection and alerting
   - Initial response and triage
   - Communication protocols
   - Escalation paths
   - Resolution and verification
   - Post-incident review

3. **Contact Information**

   - Status update template
   - Resolution notification template
   - Post-mortem template

## Notes

This is the final task in the epic and represents the culmination of all previous work. Take time to thoroughly validate each system component before declaring the deployment successful.

Schedule the production deployment during low-traffic hours if possible, and ensure the team is available for immediate response if issues arise.

After successful production deployment, conduct a retrospective to identify learnings and improvements for future deployments.

**Celebration Moment:** After successful production deployment and 24-hour stability, celebrate with the team! This is a significant milestone.
