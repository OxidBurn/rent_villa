# Task: Documentation & Runbooks

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the CI/CD pipeline, deployment procedures, rollback processes, and troubleshooting guides. This documentation enables team members to confidently deploy, monitor, and maintain the application in production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI/CD workflow documentation complete with diagrams
- [ ] Deployment procedure runbook created
- [ ] Rollback process documented with step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common scenarios
- [ ] Environment variable reference documented
- [ ] Emergency response procedures defined
- [ ] All documentation reviewed and validated by team

## Technical Details

### Documentation Structure

   - Environment breakdown (dev/staging/production)

2. **`docs/deployment/deployment-runbook.md`**
   - Pre-deployment checklist
   - Step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Post-deployment validation steps
   - Smoke testing procedures
   - Production promotion workflow

3. **`docs/deployment/rollback-procedures.md`**
   - When to rollback
   - Vercel instant rollback steps
   - Database migration rollback
   - Rollback validation checklist
   - Post-rollback communication template

4. **`docs/deployment/troubleshooting-guide.md`**
   - Common CI failures and fixes
   - Deployment failures and resolution
   - Database connection issues
   - Environment variable problems
   - Build failures
   - Test failures in CI

5. **`docs/deployment/environment-variables.md`**
   - Complete environment variable reference
   - Required vs optional variables
   - How to add/update variables in Vercel
   - Secret management best practices
   - Local development setup

6. **`docs/deployment/incident-response.md`**
   - Severity classification
   - Incident response team contacts
   - Communication templates
   - Post-mortem template

### Content Requirements

Each document should include:

- Clear, concise writing (no jargon without explanation)
- Step-by-step instructions with commands/screenshots
- Examples of success and failure scenarios
- Links to relevant tools (Vercel dashboard, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Last updated date and owner

### Key Sections to Cover

**CI/CD Workflow Documentation:**

- Trigger conditions for CI pipeline
- Jobs that run in each environment
- How to interpret CI results
- Common failure modes and fixes

**Deployment Procedures:**

- How to deploy to staging (automatic on merge)
- How to promote to production
- Pre-deployment validation checklist
- Post-deployment smoke tests
- How to verify deployment success

**Rollback Process:**

- Identifying when rollback is needed
- Vercel instant rollback (one-click)
- Database migration rollback with Drizzle
- Verifying rollback success
- Communication during rollback

**Troubleshooting:**

- CI pipeline failures
- Build errors
- Test failures
- Database connection issues
- Environment variable problems
- Performance degradation

### Code Locations/Files Affected

- `docs/deployment/ci-cd-overview.md` (new)
- `docs/deployment/deployment-runbook.md` (new)
- `docs/deployment/rollback-procedures.md` (new)
- `docs/deployment/troubleshooting-guide.md` (new)
- `docs/deployment/environment-variables.md` (new)
- `docs/deployment/incident-response.md` (new)
- `README.md` (update with links to deployment docs)

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001: GitHub Actions CI Workflow (document CI pipeline)
- [x] Task 002: Vercel Deployment Setup (document Vercel workflows)
- [x] Task 003: Vitest Test Infrastructure (document testing)
- [x] Task 004: Playwright E2E Testing (document E2E tests)
- [x] Task 005: Database & Migration Setup (document migrations)
- [x] Task 006: Code Quality Tooling (document linting/formatting)
- [x] Task 007: Sentry Error Tracking (document monitoring)
- [x] Task 008: Health Check & Monitoring (document health checks)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: Medium (M)
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (documentation only, no code conflicts)

### Time Breakdown

- CI/CD overview documentation: 1.5 hours
- Deployment runbook: 1.5 hours
- Rollback procedures: 1 hour
- Troubleshooting guide: 2 hours
- Environment variables reference: 1 hour
- Incident response procedures: 1 hour
- Review and refinement: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All documentation files created and committed
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for accuracy and clarity
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions tested by team member
- [ ] Screenshots/diagrams added where helpful
- [ ] Links between documents validated
- [ ] README.md updated with documentation links
- [ ] Team walkthrough completed
- [ ] Documentation accessible to all team members
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Merged to main branch

## Documentation Standards

Follow these standards for all documentation:

1. **Structure:**
   - Clear headings and table of contents
   - Numbered steps for procedures
   - Code blocks for commands
   - Screenshots for UI-heavy steps

2. **Writing Style:**
   - Active voice, present tense
   - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Avoid jargon or explain technical terms

3. **Maintenance:**
   - Include "Last Updated" date at top
   - Assign document owner
   - Review quarterly or after major changes

4. **Examples:**
   - Provide real examples, not placeholders
   - Show both success and failure scenarios
   - Include expected output

## Testing Strategy

1. **Peer Review**
   - Have another developer review each document
   - Test procedures step-by-step
   - Validate all commands and links

2. **Walkthrough Session**
   - Conduct team walkthrough of all documentation
   - Gather feedback and incorporate improvements
   - Ensure team understands procedures

3. **Validation Checklist**
   - [ ] All commands tested and work as documented
   - [ ] All links are valid and point to correct resources
   - [ ] Screenshots are current and accurate
   - [ ] Procedures can be followed by new team member
   - [ ] Documentation covers 80% of common scenarios

## Notes

This is a critical task that should be completed after all technical implementation tasks are done, so the documentation accurately reflects the final implementation. The documentation can be created in parallel with Task 010 (Production Deployment) but should be reviewed before final production deployment.

Documentation is living and should be updated as the system evolves. Consider this initial version as v1.0 that will be refined based on team feedback and real-world usage.
