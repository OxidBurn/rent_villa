# Task: GitHub Actions CI Workflow

## Description
Set up a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs automated checks on every pull request and push to main. The workflow should include linting, type checking, testing, and building to ensure code quality before merging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow file created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] Workflow includes lint job using `npm run lint`
- [ ] Workflow includes type checking job using `tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Workflow includes test job (placeholder until Vitest is set up)
- [ ] Workflow includes build job using `npm run build`
- [ ] Jobs run in parallel for faster execution
- [ ] Workflow triggers on pull requests and pushes to main branch
- [ ] Node.js version matches project requirements (20.x or higher)
- [ ] Dependencies are cached to improve workflow speed

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` using GitHub Actions YAML syntax
- Configure jobs to run on `ubuntu-latest` runner
- Use `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4`
- Implement dependency caching with `actions/cache` or setup-node cache feature
- Configure jobs to run in parallel using matrix strategy if needed

**Key Considerations:**
- Use appropriate Node.js version (20.x recommended for Next.js 16)
- Ensure all jobs fail fast to provide quick feedback
- Configure proper working directory if needed
- Add status badges to README (optional)

**Files Affected:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new file)
- Potentially `README.md` for status badges

## Dependencies
- [ ] None - this is a foundational task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S (Small)
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented - CI workflow file created and committed
- [ ] Tests written and passing - CI workflow runs successfully on test PR
- [ ] Documentation updated - README includes CI status badge or workflow description
- [ ] Code reviewed - PR reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging - Workflow active on main branch
