# Project Brief

## What It Does

**Rent Villa** is a web-based rental property management system that helps landlords and property managers efficiently manage their rental properties, tenants, and lease agreements in one centralized platform.

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Property managers and landlords struggle with fragmented tools, manual processes, and lack of visibility into their rental portfolio. Critical information is scattered across spreadsheets, paper documents, and multiple software systems, leading to missed renewals, lost documents, and inefficient operations.

### Solution
Rent Villa consolidates all rental management activities into a single, modern web application that provides:
- Centralized property and tenant information
- Automated lease tracking and reminders
- Streamlined document management
- Real-time portfolio visibility
- Simplified administrative workflows

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Property management (CRUD operations)
- Tenant information tracking
- Lease agreement management
- Document storage and retrieval
- Dashboard with portfolio overview
- User authentication and authorization
- Responsive web interface
- Financial tracking (rent, expenses)
- Maintenance request logging
- Automated notifications and reminders

### Out of Scope (Initial Release)
- Mobile native applications (iOS/Android)
- Accounting software integration (QuickBooks, Xero)
- Multi-language support
- White-label/multi-tenant SaaS platform
- Public property listing marketplace
- Tenant portal (self-service)
- Payment processing integration
- Background checks and credit reports
- Marketing and lead generation tools

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Simplify Property Management:** Reduce time spent on administrative tasks by 50%
2. **Improve Data Accessibility:** All property information accessible in < 3 clicks
3. **Reduce Missed Renewals:** Automatic alerts for lease expirations 60 days in advance
4. **Centralize Documents:** Single repository for all rental-related documents
5. **Enhance Decision-Making:** Real-time dashboard showing portfolio health

### Secondary Goals
6. Improve tenant satisfaction through better communication
7. Reduce vacancy periods through proactive management
8. Increase rent collection rates with payment tracking
9. Build foundation for future SaaS expansion
10. Establish modern, maintainable codebase

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- ✅ Application loads in < 2 seconds
- ✅ 99.9% uptime (post-launch)
- ✅ Zero data loss incidents
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Secure authentication and authorization
- ✅ Type-safe codebase (TypeScript)

### Business Success
- ✅ Support management of 100+ properties
- ✅ User satisfaction > 4.5/5
- ✅ Core feature adoption > 70%
- ✅ Active user retention > 80% after 3 months
- ✅ Positive ROI within 12 months

### User Success
- ✅ New users can add first property in < 5 minutes
- ✅ Intuitive UI requiring minimal training
- ✅ Faster than existing manual processes
- ✅ Reliable and trustworthy data storage
- ✅ Helpful support and documentation

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Stack:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript (fixed)
- **Hosting:** Must support Node.js runtime
- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
- **Performance Budget:** Time to Interactive < 3 seconds on 3G

### Business Constraints
- **Timeline:** MVP in 3-4 months
- **Budget:** Bootstrap/self-funded (cost-conscious decisions)
- **Team Size:** Small team (1-3 developers)
- **Market:** Initially targeting US rental market

### Regulatory Constraints
- **Data Privacy:** GDPR/CCPA compliance for user data
- **Security:** Encrypted data storage and transmission
- **Fair Housing:** Ensure no discriminatory features
- **Document Retention:** Comply with state/local record-keeping laws

## Key Assumptions

1. **User Skill Level:** Users have basic computer literacy
2. **Internet Access:** Users have stable internet connection
3. **Data Volume:** Average user manages 5-50 properties
4. **Usage Pattern:** Daily active usage by primary users
5. **Growth Rate:** Gradual user acquisition (not viral launch)
6. **Payment Model:** Freemium or subscription-based (TBD)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Data Security:** Sensitive tenant and financial information
  - **Mitigation:** Implement industry-standard encryption, regular security audits

- **User Adoption:** Resistance to change from manual processes
  - **Mitigation:** Simple onboarding, clear value proposition, migration assistance

### Medium Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Feature requests expanding beyond MVP
  - **Mitigation:** Strict prioritization, phased roadmap, say "no" to non-essentials

- **Technical Complexity:** Underestimating development effort
  - **Mitigation:** Incremental development, regular demos, adjust timeline as needed

### Low Risks
- **Technology Risk:** Next.js/React are mature, well-supported technologies
- **Market Risk:** Clear need exists based on current pain points

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Product Owner:** Defines vision and priorities
- **Development Team:** Builds and maintains application
- **End Users:** Property managers and landlords

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Tenants:** Indirectly benefit from better management
- **Property Owners:** Benefit from professional management tools
- **Investors:** (If applicable) Track ROI and business metrics
