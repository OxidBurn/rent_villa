# PRD: Complete Development Pipeline Setup

## Executive Summary

Establish a comprehensive, automated development pipeline for Rent Villa that ensures code quality, enables rapid deployment, and provides confidence in production releases. This pipeline will support the team's ability to ship features quickly while maintaining high standards for security, performance, and reliability.

**Value Proposition:** Reduce deployment risk by 90%, decrease time-to-production from manual hours to <15 minutes, and catch bugs before they reach users through automated testing and quality gates.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **No Automated Testing**: Zero test coverage means bugs are discovered in production
2. **Manual Deployments**: Time-consuming, error-prone manual deployment process
3. **No Quality Gates**: Code can be merged without type checks, linting, or validation
4. **No CI/CD**: Every push requires manual verification of builds
5. **No Database Pipeline**: No strategy for schema migrations or data seeding
6. **Limited Monitoring**: No visibility into production errors or performance
7. **No Environment Management**: Unclear separation between dev, staging, and production

### Why Now?

- Project is in early stages - perfect time to establish patterns
- Before adding features (properties, tenants, leases), need reliable deployment process
- Database integration is coming - need migration pipeline ready
- Multiple developers will collaborate - need automated checks to maintain quality
- Production launch approaching - need confidence in release process

### Impact of Inaction

Without a proper pipeline:

- Bugs ship to production undetected
- Development velocity slows due to manual processes
- Team lacks confidence in deployments
- Rollbacks are difficult and risky
- Technical debt accumulates rapidly
- Collaboration becomes challenging without CI checks

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

#### 1. Developer (Primary User)

**Goals:**

- Ship features confidently without breaking production
- Get fast feedback on code quality
- Focus on feature development, not deployment mechanics

**Pain Points:**

- Uncertain if changes will break production
- Slow manual testing processes
- Anxiety about deployments

#### 2. Tech Lead / DevOps

**Goals:**

- Ensure code quality standards are met
- Enable team to move fast safely
- Maintain production stability

**Pain Points:**

- Manual review burden is high
- No automated enforcement of standards
- Production incidents require manual investigation

#### 3. Product Manager

**Goals:**

- Ship features to users quickly
- Confidence that releases work as expected
- Clear visibility into deployment status

**Pain Points:**

- Unclear when features will be in production
- Frequent rollbacks due to bugs
- Long lead time from development to user value

### User Journeys

- Can be implemented incrementally while building features

### Resource Constraints

- 1-3 developers available
- Limited budget for paid tools (prefer free tiers)
- No dedicated DevOps engineer (must be developer-friendly)
- No existing infrastructure to migrate from

### Business Constraints

- Must not block feature development entirely

2. Developers have basic understanding of CI/CD concepts
3. GitHub is the source of truth for code
4. Vercel is acceptable as deployment platform
5. PostgreSQL will be chosen as database
6. Team prefers configuration over complex scripting
7. YAML is acceptable for pipeline definitions

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Included

   - Terraform or Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning
   - Reason: Using managed platforms (Vercel) removes need

2. **Container Orchestration:**
   - Kubernetes, Docker Swarm setup
   - Reason: Over-engineered for initial scale

3. **Multi-Region Deployments:**
   - Global CDN distribution beyond Vercel defaults
   - Reason: Not needed for initial launch

4. **Advanced Security Scanning:**
   - SAST/DAST tools (SonarQube, Snyk premium features)
   - Reason: Basic security sufficient for MVP

5. **Custom Build Optimization:**
   - Custom webpack configuration
   - Advanced caching strategies
   - Reason: Next.js defaults are sufficient

6. **Mobile App Pipeline:**
   - iOS/Android build and deployment
   - Reason: No mobile apps planned yet

7. **Load Testing Pipeline:**
   - Automated performance/load testing
   - Reason: Premature for current scale

8. **Feature Flag System:**
   - LaunchDarkly or similar integration
   - Reason: Can be added later if needed

9. **A/B Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Experimentation platform integration
   - Reason: Not needed for MVP

10. **Advanced Monitoring:**
    - Distributed tracing
    - Custom metrics and dashboards
    - Reason: Basic monitoring sufficient initially
