## Incident Severity Classification

All incidents are classified by severity to determine response priority and escalation.

### Severity 1 (Critical) - Immediate Response

**Definition**: Complete service outage or critical functionality unavailable

**Examples**:

- Application completely down (500 errors on all pages)
- Database connection lost (all queries failing)
- Data corruption or data loss
- Security breach or unauthorized access
- Payment processing completely broken

**Response Time**: Immediate (< 5 minutes)
**Response Team**: All hands on deck
**Communication**: Public status page + user notification

**Action**:

1. Page on-call engineer immediately
2. Engage incident commander
3. Initiate emergency response
4. Consider immediate rollback

---

### Severity 2 (High) - Urgent Response

**Definition**: Major functionality degraded or unavailable for subset of users

**Examples**:

- Elevated error rate (>5% of requests failing)
- Critical feature not working (authentication, search, checkout)
- Significant performance degradation (>50% slower)
- Database queries timing out frequently
- API endpoints returning 500 errors

**Response Time**: Within 15 minutes
**Response Team**: Engineering team + tech lead
**Communication**: Internal notification + status page update

**Action**:

1. Notify engineering team
2. Assess impact and root cause
3. Determine if rollback needed
4. Implement fix or rollback

---

### Severity 3 (Medium) - Standard Response

**Definition**: Non-critical functionality impaired, workarounds available

**Examples**:

- Minor feature not working (image upload, export)
- Intermittent errors affecting <5% of requests
- Performance degradation <50%
- Non-critical API endpoints failing
- UI bugs affecting some users

**Response Time**: Within 1 hour (business hours)
**Response Team**: Engineering team
**Communication**: Internal notification only

**Action**:

1. Create incident ticket
2. Investigate and fix during business hours
3. Deploy fix in next scheduled deployment

---

### Severity 4 (Low) - Deferred Response

**Definition**: Cosmetic issues, documentation errors, minor bugs

**Examples**:

- Typos in UI
- Layout issues on specific browsers
- Non-critical documentation errors
- Minor logging issues

**Response Time**: Next sprint
**Response Team**: Assigned engineer
**Communication**: None (track in backlog)

**Action**:

1. Create bug ticket
2. Add to backlog
3. Fix in next sprint

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection (0-5 minutes)

Incidents are typically detected through:

- **Automated Alerts**:
  - Vercel deployment failure notification
  - Sentry error rate spike alert
  - Health check endpoint failing
  - Database connection alerts

- **Manual Reports**:
  - User reports via support
  - Team member notices issue
  - Monitoring dashboard review

**Action**: Acknowledge alert, assess severity

---

### Phase 2: Assessment (5-15 minutes)

#### Quick Assessment Checklist

1. **Verify the Issue**

   ```bash
   # Check production health
   curl https://rent-villa.com/api/health

   # Check error rate in Sentry
   # Check Vercel deployment status
   ```

2. **Determine Scope**
   - What percentage of users affected?
   - Which features/pages broken?
   - Error rate increasing or stable?

3. **Identify Trigger**
   - Recent deployment?
   - Database migration?
   - Third-party service outage?
   - Traffic spike?

4. **Classify Severity**
   - Use severity matrix above
   - Declare severity level

**Output**: Incident severity and initial assessment

---

### Phase 3: Response (15-60 minutes)

#### For Severity 1 & 2 Incidents

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Assemble Incident Team**

   ```
   Post in #incidents Slack channel:

   ðŸš¨ SEV-1 INCIDENT DECLARED

   Issue: {brief description}
   Impact: {user impact}
   Commander: {name}
   War Room: {Zoom/Slack link}

   @engineering-team please join
   ```

2. **Create Incident War Room**
   - Start Zoom call or dedicated Slack thread
   - All communication in war room
   - Assign roles

3. **Stabilize Service**

   **Option A: Rollback** (if recent deployment)

   ```bash
   # Via Vercel dashboard - instant
   # See: docs/deployment/rollback-procedures.md
   ```

   **Option B: Quick Fix**

   ```bash
   # If fix is simple and known
   git checkout -b hotfix/incident-{id}
   # Make fix
   git commit -m "hotfix: {description}"
   git push
   # Emergency merge and deploy
   ```

   **Option C: Disable Feature**

   ```bash
   # If specific feature causing issue
   # Set feature flag to disable
   vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_X_ENABLED false production
   vercel redeploy --prod
   ```

4. **Monitor Stability**
   - Watch error rate in Sentry
   - Monitor health endpoint
   - Check Vercel metrics
   - Confirm user impact reduced

#### For Severity 3 & 4 Incidents

- Create ticket in Linear
- Assign to engineer
- Fix in normal workflow
- Deploy in next scheduled deployment

---

### Phase 4: Communication (Ongoing)

#### Internal Communication

Update #incidents Slack channel every 15-30 minutes:

```
ðŸ”„ INCIDENT UPDATE

Status: {Investigating/Fixing/Monitoring/Resolved}
Time: {timestamp}

### Phase 5: Resolution (Variable)

**Incident Resolved When**:

- âœ… Error rate back to baseline
- âœ… Health checks passing
- âœ… User-reported issues resolved
- âœ… Monitoring shows stability for 30+ minutes
- âœ… Fix deployed and validated

**Actions**:

1. **Confirm Resolution**

   ```bash
   # Verify health
   curl https://rent-villa.com/api/health

   # Check Sentry error rate
   # Check Vercel metrics
   ```

2. **Communicate Resolution**

   ```
   âœ… INCIDENT RESOLVED

   Duration: {start time} - {end time}
   Root Cause: {brief summary}
   Resolution: {what fixed it}
   Impact: {final user impact}

   Post-mortem will be scheduled.
   ```

3. **Monitor Post-Resolution**
   - Watch for 1-2 hours after resolution
   - Ensure no regression
   - Keep team on standby

### Incident Metrics

Track these metrics quarterly:

- **Incident Count**: Total incidents by severity
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: How fast we detect issues
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: How fast we resolve issues
- **Repeat Incidents**: Same issue occurring multiple times
- **Incident-Free Days**: Days without incidents

**Goal**:

- MTTD: < 5 minutes
- MTTR (SEV-1): < 30 minutes
- MTTR (SEV-2): < 2 hours
- Repeat Incidents: 0

## Best Practices

### 1. Blameless Culture

- Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- Encourage reporting near-misses
- Learn from mistakes
- No punishment for production incidents

---

### 2. Practice Incident Response

- Run incident drills quarterly
- Practice rollback procedures
- Test communication channels
- Rotate incident commander role

---

### 3. Document Everything

- Log all actions during incident
- Capture screenshots/logs
- Record timeline
- Write thorough post-mortems

---

### 4. Learn and Improve

- Review all SEV-1 and SEV-2 incidents
- Implement action items
- Track repeat incidents
- Share learnings across team

---

### 5. Proactive Monitoring

- Set up alerts before issues become incidents
- Monitor error rates continuously
- Watch for early warning signs
- Use health checks

---

### 6. Clear Escalation Path

Everyone should know:

- How to declare an incident
- Who to contact for help
- When to escalate
- Where to find documentation
